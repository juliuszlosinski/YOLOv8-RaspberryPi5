# Project description:

This repository implements YOLOv8, a leading deep learning model, for object detection, image segmentation, and pose estimation on the Raspberry Pi 5. It uses Halo AI kit in order to boost the model's performance, enabling faster, real-time processing while efficiently using the device's resources in edge computing environments.
